# Lab Folder

Create a subfolder for each new lab assignment (i.e. Lab1, Lab2). This will allow you to start new labs without risking breaking the previous labs that I may not have graded yet.

Copy the previous lab assignment files into the folder as needed so you are not starting from scratch each time.
