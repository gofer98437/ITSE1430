# Setup Folder

This folder contains a skeleton of what your repository should look like. Each of the files in this folder should be placed in the root of your repository.
Each folder should be created as subfolders in your repository.

The easiest way to do this is to download the class repository, then copy everything out of the Setup folder and into your repository root. Then commit the changes.
